There were 176 haplotypes sequenced in the finninsh population, and 176 Haplotypes sequenced in the yoruba population
The counts for the top three most common haplotypes in the finnish population are [41, 13, 8] While the counts of the 
top most common haplotypes in the yoruba population are [5, 3, 3]
The lactase persitance allele for finnish are ['A', 'A', 'A'] 
and ['G', 'G', 'G'] for yoruba. I think that these results are consistent with selection on lactase region.
This is because in the finnish milk drinking population, there is one haplotype that is majorly favored. In the yoruba non milk drinking oopulation,
it does not seem like there is one haplotype that is majorly favored. The fact that the nucleotides are different for the haplotypes in the yoruba vs finnish populations
also suggests that the mutations from G to A may have been advantageous for breaking down lactose.
